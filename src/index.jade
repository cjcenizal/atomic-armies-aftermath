          This is the story of how I spent 18 months struggling to become an entrepreneur, indie game dev, and millionaire before 30. Long story short: I failed. During that time, I made some of the biggest mistakes of my life, met some of the most amazing people I&rsquo;ve ever known, and managed to muddle my way into building some weird, awesome stuff.

        p.p.
          I spent most of that time developing a game called Atomic Armies. Here&rsquo;s what the game looked like when I decided to pull the plug:

          .image.image--aa1-gameplay-example
          figcaption.caption.
            After putting so much time into this game, giving it up was one of the hardest things I&rsquo;ve ever done.

        p.p.
          It looks like a Zynga game, and it basically was. But before any of the video game snobs out there write it off, I just want to say that, social games aside, the journey I took was an epic one. I poured a staggering amount of work into this. And all I got was this stupid website! Hooray!

          Let&rsquo;s rewind to April, 2010. I was 26 years old, in love with an incredible woman named Karla (whom I would later marry), and I was starting to burn out at the tail-end of a successful visual effects career. For years I had been churning out renders of particle systems and simple physics simulations which were composited into commercials and then broadcast on TV. I would do this for a few months at a time, take a break for a week or two, and then repeat the cycle. I started to feel like Phil in Groundhog Day. I needed to break free.
