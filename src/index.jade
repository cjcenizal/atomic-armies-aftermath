          This is the story of how I spent 18 months struggling to become an entrepreneur, indie game dev, and millionaire before 30. Long story short: I failed. During that time, I made some of the biggest mistakes of my life, met some of the most amazing people I&rsquo;ve ever known, and managed to muddle my way into building some weird, awesome stuff.

        p.p.
          I spent most of that time developing a game called Atomic Armies. Here&rsquo;s what the game looked like when I decided to pull the plug:

            After putting so much time into this game, giving it up was one of the hardest things I&rsquo;ve ever done.

        p.p.
          It looks like a Zynga game, and it basically was. But before any of the video game snobs out there write it off, I just want to say that, social games aside, the journey I took was an epic one. I poured a staggering amount of work into this. And all I got was this stupid post-mortem! Hooray!

          Let&rsquo;s rewind to April, 2010. I was 26 years old, in love with an incredible woman named Karla (whom I would later marry), and I was starting to burn out at the tail-end of a successful visual effects career. For a few years I had been churning out renders of particle systems and simple physics simulations which were composited into commercials and then broadcast on TV. I would do this for a few months at a time, take a break for a week or two, and then repeat the cycle. I started to feel like Phil in Groundhog Day. I needed to break free.

        p.p.
          At the time, Mafia Wars had just put Zynga on the map, dazzling tech journalists, entrepreneurs, and VCs with the magic of social gaming. &ldquo;Social&rdquo; was the buzzword of the day (later, &ldquo;mobile&rdquo; and &ldquo;local&rdquo; would usurp the throne). I decided this was my opportunity to quit my day job to fame, glory, and riches. I gave notice and I was on my own. But I had no idea what to do next.

            TLDR: Take risks when you&rsquo;re young, and move on from jobs with low returns on investment.

            I knew I wanted to marry the woman I was dating, and I knew that I really wanted to settle down (house, wife, kids, etc) at some point. Realistically, that was going to have to happen within the next 5 years, since biologically, women have the best chances at a healthy pregnancy before 35. So I had a window in which I could attempt my reach goals before I had to shift my focus to family and all that grown-up stuff.

            Up until this point, I had invested a lot of time in building a successful career as a creative coder. I had become really good at writing one-off programs that generated interesting visual effects, but I felt like I had hit a plateau. I wasn&rsquo;t learning anything new, and I wasn&rsquo;t able to build upon any of my previous work &mdash; my code for each project was essentially a rehash of the previous project. I no longer found satisfaction in my job, so the return on my time-investment was negative. In other words, I felt like I was wasting my time.
