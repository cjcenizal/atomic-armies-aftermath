        p.p.p--intro.
          This is the story of how I spent 18 months on a journey to become an entrepreneur, indie game dev, and millionaire before 30. Long story short: I failed! During that time, I made some of the biggest mistakes of my life, met some of the most amazing people I&rsquo;ve ever known, and managed to muddle my way into building some weird, awesome stuff.

        p.p.
          I spent most of that time developing a game called Atomic Armies. Here&rsquo;s what the game looked like when I decided to pull the plug:

            data-src="aa1_gameplay_example"
            data-low-res
          )
          figcaption.caption.
            After putting so much time into this game, giving it up was one of the hardest things I&rsquo;ve ever done.

        p.p.
          It looks like a Zynga game, and it basically was. But before any of the video game snobs out there write it off, I just want to say that, social games aside, the journey I took was an epic one. I poured a staggering amount of work into this. And all I got was this stupid post-mortem! Hooray!

        p.p.
          Let&rsquo;s rewind to April, 2010. I was 26 years old, in love with an incredible woman named Karla (whom I would later marry), and I was starting to burn out at the tail-end of a successful visual effects career. For a few years I had been churning out renders of particle systems and simple physics simulations which were composited into commercials and then broadcast on TV. I would do this for a few months at a time, take a break for a week or two, and then repeat the cycle. I started to feel like Phil in Groundhog Day. I needed to break free.

        p.p.
          At the time, Mafia Wars had just put Zynga on the map, dazzling tech journalists, entrepreneurs, and VCs with the magic of social gaming. &ldquo;Social&rdquo; was the buzzword of the day (later, &ldquo;mobile&rdquo; and &ldquo;local&rdquo; would usurp the throne). I decided this was my opportunity to quit my day job to fame, glory, and riches. I gave notice and I was on my own. But I had no idea what to do next.

            I think if you feel like you&rsquo;re getting less out of your job than you&rsquo;re putting in, then it&rsquo;s a good time to leave. And this is especially true when you&rsquo;re young and have fewer responsibilities, because that&rsquol;s the best time you can take risks and recover from failure.
          p.panel__p.
            In terms of my job, I had become really good at writing one-off programs that generated interesting visual effects, but I felt like I had hit a plateau. I wasn&rsquo;t learning anything new and I felt like I was wasting my time.
          p.panel__p.
            In terms of risk, I knew I wanted to marry Karla, and down that road lay responsibilities like car loans, a mortgage, and kids. Women have the best chance at a healthy pregnancy before 35, so I had a pretty hard window in which I could attempt my reach goals before I had to get serious about being a grown-up.
